This software is created to temporarily fix the error of "USB 3.0 to ethernet adapter" on xhci_hcd bus.

.The example of error message:
[source,console]
----
[ 1179.475926] kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: WARN: TRB error for slot 1 ep 5 on endpoint
[ 1179.607026] kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: WARN waiting for error on ep to be cleared
[ 1179.607049] kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: WARN waiting for error on ep to be cleared
[ 1179.607054] kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: WARN waiting for error on ep to be cleared
[ 1179.607058] kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: WARN waiting for error on ep to be cleared
----

When these errors occur, the device stop functioning until reconnect or rebind.
This software will automatically detect these error messages and then rebind the device.

== Disclaimer

CAUTION: *DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANY STORAGE DEVICES THAT CONNECT TO XHCI_HCD BUS.*
This software is meant for temporary solution to the problem of "USB 3.0 to ethernet adapter" on xhci_hcd bus only.

== Installation

=== Arch Linux

To build and install arch package from GIT source:

[source,console]
$ git clone https://github.com/bpetlert/xhci_hcd-rebind.git
$ cd xhci_hcd-rebind
$ makepkg -p PKGBUILD.local
$ pacman -U xhci_hcd-rebind-x.x.x.rx.gxxxxxxx-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst

Then enable/start xhci_hcd-rebind.service

[source,console]
$ systemctl enable xhci_hcd-rebind.service
$ systemctl start xhci_hcd-rebind.service

== Configuration

The configuration is placed in `/etc/systemd/xhci_hcd-rebind.toml` file.

.Example of configurations
[source,toml]
----
# Use `lspci -kD` to find bus id of xhci_pci
# e.g.
#   ...
#   0000:04:00.0 USB controller: NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller (rev 04)
#           Subsystem: Dell Device 0446
#           Kernel driver in use: xhci_hcd
#           Kernel modules: xhci_pci
#   ...
#
bus-id = "0000:04:00.0"

# Bus rebind delay (seconds)
#
# bus-rebind-delay = 3

# Next bus fail check delay (seconds)
#
# next-fail-check-delay = 300

# Script to run once after bus failure is found (run before unbind bus)
#
# pre-unbind-script = "/usr/local/bin/xhci_hcd-rebind-sysinfo.sh"

# Script to run once after rebind bus
#
# post-rebind-script = ""
----

The `bus-id` is required, other settings are optional.
